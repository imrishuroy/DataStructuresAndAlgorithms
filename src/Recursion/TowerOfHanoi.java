    The Tower of Hanoi problem involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, following these rules:


    Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty peg.
    All disks start on one peg and need to be moved to another peg using an intermediate peg.
    For ùëõ=3 disks, the goal is to move all disks from the source peg (A) to the
    destination peg (C) using the helper peg (B).

      Explanation
    Problem: Move n disks from peg A (source) to peg C (destination) using peg B (helper).

    Rules:

    Move one disk at a time.
    A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk.
    Program Breakdown

    Main Method:

    Initializes the number of disks (n = 3).
    Calls towerOfHanoi to solve the puzzle.
    towerOfHanoi Method:

    Base Case: If there is only 1 disk, move it directly from the source peg to the destination peg.


    Recursive Steps:

    Move n‚àí1 disks from the source peg to the helper peg.
    Move the nth disk from the source peg to the destination peg.
    Move the n‚àí1 disks from the helper peg to the destination peg.
