    // Backtracking is an improvement of the brute force approach. It systematically searches for a solution to a problem, among all the available option
    // In backtracking, we start with one possible option out of many available options and try to solve the problem if we are able to solve thr problem with the selected move, then we will print the solution,
    // else we will backtrack and select some other option and try to solve it.
    // If none of the options work out, we will claim that there is no solution for the problem
