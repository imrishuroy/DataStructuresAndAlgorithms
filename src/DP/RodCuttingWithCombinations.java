üß© ROD CUTTING PROBLEM ‚Äî COUNTING MAXIMUM VALUE COMBINATIONS (ORDERED)

üî∏ PROBLEM STATEMENT:
You are given a rod of length `n` inches and an array `cost[]`, where `cost[i]` represents the price of a rod piece of length `i + 1`.

Find the **number of different combinations (ordered)** in which you can cut the rod such that the **total selling value is maximum**.

‚ûï The order of rod pieces matters.
‚ûï You can reuse any rod length multiple times (unbounded).
‚ûï You need to count the **number of ways** to reach that maximum value.

üì• SAMPLE INPUT:
    cost = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}; // 1-based indexing
    n = 5;

üî¢ OUTPUT:
    Maximum Value = 10
    Number of Combinations = 15

üß† INTUITION:
This is a variation of the **Unbounded Knapsack Problem**, but we are also asked to count the number of **ordered permutations** that result in the **maximum value**.

We maintain two DP arrays:
1. `rod[i]` ‚Üí Stores the maximum value obtainable for rod length `i`
2. `possibilities[i]` ‚Üí Stores the number of ordered combinations that give `rod[i]`

---

üîß APPROACH:
1. Initialize `rod[0] = 0` and `possibilities[0] = 1` (1 way to make 0)
2. For each rod length `i` from 1 to `n`:
   - Try all possible first cuts `j` from 1 to `i`
   - Calculate: `value = cost[j] + rod[i - j]`
   - If this value is better than current max, update:
     - `rod[i] = value`
     - Reset `possibilities[i] = possibilities[i - j]`
   - Else if it equals the current max, add ways:
     - `possibilities[i] += possibilities[i - j]`
3. Finally, return `possibilities[n]` as the answer.

---

üì¶ TEST CASES:

1. cost = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}, n = 5 ‚Üí Output: 15
2. cost = {2, 5, 7, 8}, n = 4 ‚Üí Output: 2
   - Maximum value = 10 (cut as [2,2])
   - Ways = 2 ([2,2], [2,2])
3. cost = {1, 5, 8, 9}, n = 4 ‚Üí Output: 4
4. cost = {3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20}, n = 8 ‚Üí Output: Depends on value calculation

---

‚è±Ô∏è TIME COMPLEXITY:
- Outer loop runs for `n` times.
- Inner loop runs up to `i` times in each iteration.
- Total Time: **O(n^2)**

üß† SPACE COMPLEXITY:
- Two arrays of size `n + 1` ‚Üí **O(n)**
